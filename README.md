# Max-MSP-RNBO-Web-React-Simple-FM
A very simple FM Synth with a single modulator and carrier with a library of custom SVG-based components.

The overall aim of the project is to explore the integration of max into a "ERN" framework (Express, React and NodeJS).

Specific Goals:
- Create Sliders, Dials, Buttons (Triggers) and Switches (25% complete).
- Create Meters and Graphs (0% complete).
- Automate Interface Generation (0% complete).

To get up and running:  
1. Download node if you haven't already (I reccommend using NVM https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  
2. Clone/Download this repository (I assume you already have git dowloaded).  
3. Open a command prompt and cd (change directory) into the "Node App" folder:  
  ```cd "C:/Users/[username]/Documents/UIDemo/Node App"```  
  for example...
4. Run the following command to install necessary node libraries:    
```npm i```  
5. Run the following command to compile and run the project:  
```npm run dev-all```  
6. Go to the following address:  
7. [localhost:3000](localhost:3000/)
